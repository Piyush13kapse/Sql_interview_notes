*Basic SQL Questions*

Q1. What is SQL?
ans:-
     SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is used to query, insert, update, and delete data, as well as to define 
     and manage database structures.



Q2. Explain the purpose of SQL and its usage for querying, updating, and managing databases.
ans:-
     SQL is used to interact with relational databases, allowing users to query, update, and manage data. It helps retrieve, modify, and organize data efficiently using commands like 
     SELECT, UPDATE, CREATE, and DROP.



Q3. What are the different types of SQL statements?
ans:-
     The different types of SQL statements are:
     1. DQL (Data Query Language): `SELECT` (used to query data)
     2. DML (Data Manipulation Language): `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` (used to manipulate data)
     3. DDL (Data Definition Language): `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP` (used to define or modify database structures)
     4. DCL (Data Control Language): `GRANT`, `REVOKE` (used to manage permissions)
     5. TCL (Transaction Control Language): `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT` (used to manage transactions)



Q4. Discuss DDL (Data Definition Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language), DCL (Data Control Language), and TCL (Transaction Control Language).
ans:-
     DDL (Data Definition Language): Defines and manages database structures. Commands include `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`.
     DML (Data Manipulation Language): Manages data within the database. Commands include `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
     DCL (Data Control Language): Controls access to data. Commands include `GRANT` (give permissions) and `REVOKE` (remove permissions).
     TCL (Transaction Control Language): Manages transactions within the database. Commands include `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `SAVEPOINT`.



Q5. What is the difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP?
ans:- 
     DELETE: Removes specific rows from a table based on a condition. It can be rolled back and does not affect the table structure.
     TRUNCATE: Removes all rows from a table quickly and cannot be rolled back. It resets any auto-increment counters but does not affect the table structure.
     DROP: Removes an entire table (or database) from the database, including its structure, data, and associated constraints. It cannot be rolled back.



Q6. Explain the difference in their impact on the data and the structure of a table.
ans:-
     DELETE: Removes specific rows but keeps the table structure intact. Data can be rolled back if in a transaction.
     TRUNCATE: Removes all rows and resets any auto-increment values but keeps the table structure intact. It cannot be rolled back.
     DROP: Completely removes the table, including its data and structure. It cannot be rolled back.



Q7. What is a JOIN? What are the different types of JOINs?
ans:-
     JOIN is an SQL operation that combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

     The different types of JOINs are:
     1. INNER JOIN: Returns only matching rows from both tables.
     2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
     3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
     4. FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows when there is a match in either the left or right table.
     5. CROSS JOIN: Returns the Cartesian product of both tables (all possible combinations).



Q8. Discuss INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, and CROSS JOIN.
ans:- 
     1.INNER JOIN: Returns only the rows with matching values in both tables.
     2.LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the left table, and matching rows from the right table. Non-matching rows from the right table are returned as NULL.
     3.RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the right table, and matching rows from the left table. Non-matching rows from the left table are returned as NULL.
     4.FULL OUTER JOIN: Returns all rows when there is a match in either table. Non-matching rows from both tables are returned as NULL.
     5.CROSS JOIN: Returns the Cartesian product of both tables, i.e., all possible combinations of rows from both tables.



Q9. What is a primary key and a foreign key?
ans:- 
     Primary Key: A unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that each row has a distinct value and cannot be NULL.
     Foreign Key: A column in one table that references the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables.



Q10. What is a NULL value in SQL?
ans:-
     NULLvalue in SQL represents the absence of a value or unknown data.It is not the same as an 
     empty string or zero and is used when a value is missing or not applicable.



Q11. Define NULL and how it differs from an empty string or zero.
ans:-
     NULL in SQL represents the absence of a value or unknown data.It indicates that the value is not defined.

     It differs from:
     Empty String (`''`): A string with no characters, but still a defined value.
     Zero (`0`): A numeric value, indicating a valid but minimal number. 



Q12. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?
ans:-
     WHERE filters rows before grouping.
     HAVING filters groups after grouping with GROUP BY.



Q13. Explain their usage in filtering results for rows vs groups.
ans:-
     WHERE filters individual rows.
     HAVING filters results after aggregation (groups).



Q14. What is a subquery?
ans:-
      A subquery is a query nested inside another query.



Q15. Discuss the concept of a query inside another query, and when to use it.
ans:-
     A subquery is used to retrieve data for the outer query. It’s useful when results from one query are needed in another.



Q16. What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?

     Views simplify complex queries by storing them as reusable objects and presenting them like tables.



Q24. What is the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN?
ans:-
     INNER JOIN returns only matching rows.
     LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.



Q25. Explain how data is selected when using these two joins.
ans:-
     INNER JOIN selects matching data from both tables.

ans:-
     Atomicity: Ensures all or nothing of a transaction.
     Consistency: Ensures database integrity is maintained.
     Isolation: Ensures transactions do not interfere with each other.
     Durability: Guarantees that changes are permanent once committed.
 


Q30. What are aggregate functions in SQL? Give examples.
ans:-
     Aggregate functions perform calculations on multiple rows and return a single result. 
     Examples: COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX().

     AVG(): Returns the average of values.
     MIN(): Returns the smallest value.
     MAX(): Returns the largest value.



Q32. What are window functions in SQL?
ans:-
     Window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row, 
     without collapsing them into a single result.



Q33. Explain OVER() clauses and their use in calculations across a set of table rows.
ans:-
    The OVER() clause defines the window for window functions, 
    allowing calculations over specified rows, like calculating running totals or ranks.



Q34. How do you find duplicate records in a table?
ans:-
    Use GROUP BY with HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 to identify duplicate rows.



Q35. Use GROUP BY and HAVING to identify duplicates.
ans:-
     Example:
     SELECT column1, column2, COUNT(*) FROM table GROUP BY column1, column2 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;



Q36. What is a CASE statement in SQL?
ans:-
     The CASE statement allows conditional logic to return values based on conditions.



Q37. Explain how to use CASE for conditional logic in queries.
ans:-



Q38. What is a CROSS JOIN?
ans:-

     B-tree, Bitmap, Hash, Clustered, and Non-clustered are common types of indexes.



Q53. Discuss different indexing techniques like B-tree, Bitmap, and Hash indexes.
ans:-
     B-tree: Balanced tree, good for range queries.
     Bitmap: Efficient for columns with few distinct values.
     Hash: Fast lookup for equality searches.



Q54. What are the differences between CHAR and VARCHAR data types?
ans:-
     CHAR is fixed-length, 
     while VARCHAR is variable-length, saving space when data varies in length.



Q55. Explain the storage and performance differences between fixed-length and variable-length strings.
ans:-
     Fixed-length strings (CHAR) waste space if data is shorter than the set length.
